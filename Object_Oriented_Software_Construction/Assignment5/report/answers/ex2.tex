\section{Components}

After making clear that there is a timeframe for successful completion of the tasks, and that coming earlier (a.k.a rushing) would not grant a user any benefit, we updated our storyboard as follows:

\subsection{SketchImporter}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Good suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ It is a small part of the program, which could also be used in different drawing programs to import other images to the background.
		\item[Interfaces] \hfill \\ In general this component should receive an image file and import this to the given drawing but the interface looks a bit different because of the implementation with JHotDraw. This leads to the same interface as \textit{ImageTool}
		\item[Interactions with other components] \hfill \\ \textit{DrawingView}, \textit{ImageFigure}
		\item[Included classes or entities] \hfill \\ \textit{BackgroundImageTool} which is a extension of \textit{ImageTool}
		\item[Integration with JHotDraw] \hfill \\ Child of \textit{ImageTool}
	\end{description}

\subsection{FlatModeler}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Bad suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ It is very general and would basically contain the entire functionality, whereas components are supposed to be smaller and limited to a certain type of functionality (like WallModeler).
		\item[Interfaces] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Interactions with other components] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Included classes or entities] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Integration with JHotDraw] \hfill \\ -
	\end{description}

% In JHotDraw is an exporter feature already implemented. It could be provided through the \textit{ExportFileAction}. In addition to this to hot spots have to be implemented: In the \textit{ApplicationModel} the method \textit{createExportChooser} have to be overwritten to show all available formats in the export dialog and the method \textit{write} in the \textit{View} have to be changed to save the drawing in the selected format.

\subsection{ImageExporter}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Bad suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ The exporting feature is a general one for a drawing application and therefore it is more clever to integrate this to the framework directly. So it could be extended by different applications for different needs, for example different file formats to export.

\subsection{WebPublisher}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Good suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ Again, the usage of this component is clear and understandable from the name.
		\item[Interfaces] \hfill \\ publishPlan(image, author)
		\item[Interactions with other components] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Included classes or entities] \hfill \\ Some communication classes, also some conversion classes needed.
		\item[Integration with JHotDraw] \hfill \\ A button on a toolbar.
	\end{description}

\subsection{FurnitureFactory}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Bad suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ Dependant on the context and hence not reusable.
		\item[Interfaces] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Interactions with other components] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Included classes or entities] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Integration with JHotDraw] \hfill \\ -
	\end{description}

\subsection{ChairTableGrouping}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Bad suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ If we want to group any other types, it is not reusable as it depends on the chair and the table type.
		\item[Interfaces] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Interactions with other components] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Included classes or entities] \hfill \\ -
		\item[Integration with JHotDraw] \hfill \\ -
	\end{description}

\subsection{ConstraintValidation}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Decision] \hfill \\ Bad suggestion
		\item[Justification] \hfill \\ Very general as there are different constraints for various types of furniture - one can fill the space under the table with something, which is not the case with a solid object like the drawer. Each object group should have its own constraint validation. Additionally, one should run the constraint validation after attempted placement of the object to avoid computation overhead.
