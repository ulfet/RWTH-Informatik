Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
		Yes, it was clear for the user. The user also really likes the solution.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
		Not so much. The other parts are really possible, while VR goggles part was not realistic at all: the fighting with the other mascots is silly, not everyone wants that (might be hard for elderly). But fighting for right-earned food might also be fun for some.\\
		
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		Yes, especially when he wants to find some obscure ingredient that he needs to complete a recipe. It is also better than asking some retail worker. He agreed that it might solve his problem.

Transcript of the User Study (shortened):\\

\noindent Q: (the solution is explained) Can you take a look first? On the first box you can see a girl, this girl has a specific condition, ..., she has to find a specific product (pizza with no gluten), yet it does not have to be about just some health condition.  \\
A: It is pretty clear from the drawings and also after you explained. I think it is a quite nice solution.\\
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: To be honest, the part about VR goggles are not really realistic, but the parts before are quite realistic and possible. \\
Q: Why do you think so?\\
A: The fighting with the other mascots are for me silly, people do not want to fight each time they go shopping. Also, not good for elderly, for example, and it seems kinda silly.\\
Q: Do you think that people would find this fun? Did you find this idea fun?\\
A: It could be fun, yeah. You can just get into the game (like role-playing) and in the end, you get your hard earned food, but I do not think it is a viable solution here.\\
Q: Do you have such a problem (of finding the right food)\\
A: (explains his experience, especially about specific recipes calling for specific ingredients) This kind of thing would help. So yes.

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
		Yes, only the game part is not very clear. How is he going to kill the other mascots was not clear. One other question was whether VR goggles are going to provided by the market.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	He is both concerned about the number of available screens in the market and who would provide the VR goggles. In short, he does not find it that much realistic.\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		He thinks this would not solve his problems in its current form. He would like to have it in a way that more than one item is searchable via the application, so we would not spend so much time in front of the screen. However, he finds this promising.\\
		(he is also curious whether people would be concerned about gazes of others, as this application would be out in the open and everyone would see what he searched for)\\
		He said playing games in home and coming to fetch the coupons would be more fun!

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	Yes, it is quite clear. The user were able to explain the solution completely by putting himself in the shoes of the example in the storyboard.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Much more realistic than the Solution \#1. Also, he finds this solution innovative to come up with.\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	Yes, definitely. He also goes around the shop and got bored afterwards seeing all the same places, and this would really improve his experience.\\
\end{compactitem}
\bigskip

\noindent Q: (solution explained) The storyboard is a bit obscure (the candidate agrees). You can choose a routing based on your preference. (...) In a time range, if the customer goes to the cash desk, with the mascot cherishing for you. Do you understand the solution?\\
A: Yes, quite clearly. (the user explains in a short manner)\\
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: Yes, especially compared to the solution \#1. As long as the layout of the shop significantly changes, it is pretty innovative thing to come up with.\\
Q: Do you find the solution fun?\\
A: Yes, unlike the first one, it does not interfere with my shopping, and if I am fast enough, and with a coupon that is a positive feedback, that is actually pretty good.\\
Q: (some extra questions on usability)

	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	Yes, user understands the solution and can explain the solution with his own words.
	\\
	
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Yes, but the user finds it not so viable for the supermarket, as supermarkets want the customers to spend more time inside, so the customers would buy more.

	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	Yes, the user agrees that this product would solve his problem, yet he is curious about the approaches of the supermarkets towards this product. Moreover, he does not want to be seen running around for coupons (it is explained that there would be time frame, so no early finishers would be gifted coupons)

\noindent Q: (solution explained as before) \\
A: (finds the mascot not decipherable, explains the solution in his words) \\
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: Realistic, but one catch: there is a product like that. It is also counterproductive in the sense of supermarket, they want people to spend money. Good for the customer, not so good for the supermarket.\\
Q: Do you think that this solution can solve your problem?\\
A: Definitely. Would help me in my shopping, no doubt.\\
Q: Would it be more fun? \\
A: Nobody would like to look cheap running around (we explained that there would be a timeframe, not would be a race to go earlier)\\

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	In general she understood the solution. The only one problem what made her confused was possibility to try different dishes. She described that storyboard shows "normal" size dish instead of little portion to try. I had to clarify that main idea is to get inspiration what to cook.\\
	
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	She is around 40 years old and she is not technological geek. So didn't get valuable response. She just said "Yeah why not, that will be beneficial for users and supermarkets Such solution will definitely attract people."\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	She really like this solution. "I'm always tired and bored after 8 hours of work. Before relaxing in the front of TV i have to do everyday shopping.". The only one aspect what made her confused, was that even though after relaxing in the massage chair she has to cook at home. She said "What about - buying HEALTHY dishes in supermarket? I can imaging reading my favourite book in the store and someone else is preparing food for me. But it has to be healthy and well prepared. Then I will be able even to pay little bit more. Yeah that sounds better. I will pick what my family wants to eat and then I will have 30 min of relax."

Answers:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item Do the users understand the solution?\\
	He understood the solution, and he explained storyboard correctly. He had just one idea for improvement "I don't see sense of making
parallel stories. One story without your system and one with your system. I think better will be focus on yours system, and not show how ordinary shopping look - everyone know that."\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	He was really pessimistic about the solution. He was complaining about the price and target users. "Firstly that will be extremely expensive to implement. Whole supermarkets will have to have 
larger dimensions.. System itself will be expensive. If you will provide 10 massage chairs. What about other people waiting for massage? Maybe better will be to called it "Massage and food" and provide something like restaurant. And skip the concept of implementing it in supermarkets."\\
	
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	He said that it will be nice improvement in shopping. But as mentioned earlier - hard to implement. \\

		Yes, the user did understood the solution and she was able to correctly explain solution by herself.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
		Even though she isn't a technological geek, she found realistic since the solution uses an app and screen on refrigerator, similiar to the one she has at her home.\\
		
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		User opinion is that she thinks it would be great to encourage kids to buying healthy food and she would love some help with planning what to buy, 
but she isn't entirely convinced that most kids would enjoy cartoons about healthy food. In general, she feels that this solution would solve her problems
if cartoons were entertaining for kids
\end{compactitem}
\bigskip

Q: (the solution is explained) Is the explanation clear to you?
A: Yes it is.
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: Yeah, why not? Escpecially the screen part, because it is similiar to the one I have on the fridge.
Q: Do you think that people would find this fun? Did you find this idea fun?\\
A: I think it should be fun for kids, but cartoons have to be really good in order to make them enjoy them. From my experience,
healthy food topic isn't most favourite for most kids.
Q: In overall, do you think that this idea would solve your problem?\\
A: Yes it would solve the problem, because having a kid who would help me in a shop would be great, since 4 hands are better than two, but as I said before -
it all depends on quality of cartoons. Another thing of course is that it would great to encourage kids to eat healthy food.

Q: (the solution is explained) Is the explanation clear to you? \\
A: Yes, I think it is.
Q: Do you find the solution realistic?\\
A: I think that on tech side it is quite easy to implement. However, it might be problematic to create those cartoons. It would be a process like creating another
cartoon for big kids TV. It requires many creative people, like movie directors, to be involved to which the creators of the solutions would need to pay.
Q: Do you think that people would find this fun? Did you find this idea fun?
A: If done right, I think it would be fun.
Q: In overall, do you think that this idea would solve your problems with food shopping?\\
A: It's very important for me to eat healthy so any app that would help reduce time spent on planning and shopping would be great, as it is time consuming and I don't
have that much time, especially now, pre exams. As for now I think that this solution isn't best for me, because I don't have kids! (laughs). 
Q: How about future?
A: Yeah, I can imagine that I would like to have some help from kids in shopping. That would be much better that doing shopping with bored one.

		Yes, he did understood it correctly.\\
	
	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
		He thinks that on technological side of the solution it is realistic, however he stated that cartoons would be suitable only for smaller kids. In his opinion 
most kids who are in later years on a primary schools wouldn't enjoy those cartoons.
\\
		
	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
		The user did like the idea, especially since he is a marathon runner who needs to eat healthy. He felt that
it would decrease his time spent on daily routine of planning and buying healthy food. Also, he noted, that there has to be huge amount of cartoons created in order to have one per every shopping.

\end{compactitem}

Q: (the solution is explained) Is the explanation clear to you?
A: Yes it is, but I have some issues with this solution.
Q: What issues?
A: I think that only smaller kids would enjoy cartoons about "happy healthy carrots" etc. Let's say those who are before 4th grade of primary school. Also, 
to cover a whole year of shopping a lot of cartoons should be made. Almost like "Bold and Beutiful" (laughs)!
Q: Do you think that the solution is realistic?
A: Yes it is. It's only app and a screen on fridge.
Q: In overall, do you think that this idea would solve your problems with food shopping?
A: I think it would help me, because I'm one of those who very often forgets about what I have in a fridge and since I have to follow a diet during my
training period, an app that would remind me what I have at home would be good - It would definitely decrease time spent on thinking in shop.

	\item Do the users find the solution realistic?\\
	Yes, they are sure that when child will see his favorite character, will follow him. They restricted that probably it would have better feedback in bigger cities.\\
	Also, they mentioned about seeing in shopping malls a lot of children sitting in the cart with smartphone and watching some cartoon, and said that our solution is much better.\\
	Additionally I asked if they would pay for rent of glasses, they said yes, and compared this to shopping carts in shape of cars.\\

	\item Do the users feel that this solution can solve his/her problem(s)? If not, what is still
	a problem? Is there a solution that could solve this?\\
	Only problem they see is accepting this solution by shopping malls. They also suggest way for convincing sellers to use our system - character that child sees could show parents some alternatives (f.e. family goes for cereals -> system suggests going to shelf with milk)\\

\chapter{Our Evaluation}

\textbf{Pros \& Cons of Each Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Solution \#1:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) People are conscious about the ingredients (culture, preference, or a specific recipe calling for certain product), and this solution caters directly to this behavior.
			\item (-) Might not be helpful, and people prefer to be accompanied until the place of a product, just telling them "Aisle 10" might not help, as our user studies suggest.
			\item (-) Screen of big display allowing gazes of other passerby people might push people off from using this device, as suggested by our user studies.
		\end{compactitem}
	
	\item Solution \#2:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) Directing people directly to the products one-by-one observed as something really enjoyable. One user off-record commented that they would really enjoy audial routing option, just like a robot being controlled.
			\item (-) Might not be wanted by the supermarkets, as supermarkets want people to stay as much as possible, so those people can spend more.
			\item (-) People might rush to the cash desks (this has been argued with users that there would be a time-frame, yet, this has been mentioned a lot, that is why this is added here).
			\item (+)The use of mascot is thought to be well-appreciated, and it can be customized based on the customer.
		\end{compactitem}
		
		\item Solution \#3:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) Supermarkets will have larger group of trusted customers. People who will find shopping more fun, not just everyday duty.
\item (-) Our solution will be extremely expensive to implement. We'll need space in supermarkets for our chairs. Probably that will have to be included in architect projects. -> that will cause extra fees.
\item (-) Supermarkets will need to hire extra employees - chefs to preparing dishes. That will cause another demand, kitchen in the supermarket.

		\end{compactitem}
		
				\item Solution \#4:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) The solution would help people organize healthy eating and is very realistic to implement
						\item (+) It would encourage kids to help parents with shopping 
\item (-) It would take a lot of creative work to create interesting cartoons about healthy food for kids. It would also be costly since a lot of cartoons needs to be created to cover at least whole year of shopping.
\item (-) Most likely it would be a solution for smaller kids only

		\end{compactitem}
		
	\item Solution \#6:
		\begin{compactitem}[*]
			\item (+) Parents are avoiding shopping if they have nobody to leave children with, this solution would eliminate problem.
			\item (+) Time of shopping may be longer because children would like to go shops more often.
			\item (-) There is a chance that shops wouldn't accept this idea, because children often convince their parents to buy something they want.
			\item (-) Propably pretty big costs of AR glasses.
