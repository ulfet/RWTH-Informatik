    The function call xs ^^^ ys evaluates to xs to the power of ys interpreted as vectors, where the negative
    entries of ys are ignored. In other words, [x1, x2, ..., xn] ^^^ [y1, y2, ..., yn] == x1 ^ y1
    * x2 ^ y2 * ... * xn ^ yn.

    For example:
        [1, 4, 5] ^^^ [7, 2, 3] evaluates to 1 ^ 7 * 4 ^ 2 * 5 ^ 3 == 2000 
        [1, 4, 5] ^^^ [5, -1, 0] evaluates to 1 ^ 5 * 5 ^ 0 == 1.
    
    â€¢ xs ^^^ ys * z, where xs and ys have type [Int] and z has type Int, is a valid expression.
