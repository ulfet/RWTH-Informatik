\section{Solution \#1:}

The \textbf{updated} storyboard for this solution:\\
(after the last discussion with our advisor, we decided to update this solution to bring more joy and enjoyment in it; and we stood away from pure efficiency)

\subsection{Core Activities of this Solution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item synchronization of a shopping list, from a smartphone to the tablet attached to the handle of a shopping cart
	
%	\item barcode scanning
	
	\item companion communicating with the user about the general shopping issues (discounts, completed percentage of a shopping list)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Reason for Prototype Selection}

We picked paper prototype, as we are designing a tablet application. The use of this product would be heavily depending on the interaction of a user with the graphical user interface of the application.\\

Although we did not glue those papers together, this prototype is designed with flipbook prototypes in mind, and will be adjusted to be displayed under a cardboard which resembles a tablet.

\subsection{Prototyping Process Explained}

We identified the core activities of this solution, as stated above. Based on those identified core activities, we also listed all the possible interactions of a user with the system. Those are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item welcome screen\\
	(\autoref{s1:synch} top)
	
	\item synchronization of shopping list (from smartphone to tablet)\\
	(\autoref{s1:synch} bottom)
	
	\item barcode scanning, and removal of respective items from the list based on what is scanned\\
	(\autoref{s1:barcode} top and bottom)
	
	\item notifications about proximity and discount of products \\
	(\autoref*{s1:offer} top and bottom)
	
	\item incomplete cart notification \\
	(\autoref{s1:percentage})
\end{itemize}
