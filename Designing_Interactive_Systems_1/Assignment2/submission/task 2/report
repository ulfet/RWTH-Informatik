Both Ania and Kacper have struggled with understanding the remote control. Maybe ON/OFF button is obvious but the rest definitely not. Both of them had no idea what is doing button SLEEP. They were right, becouse no one will know that. Aditionally wifi sign is misliding. Yes is not wifi, probably that is light sight - with is signifier of swithing on and off the light. But that is missleading. 
The line in the middle of the remote control is also not correct. It groups buttons in unupropriate grupus. The idea should be that the main buttons ON/OFF and SLEEP are one group and buttons A and B are the secound group. Why? Because that will be intuitive. That you have one area of programmed and build in functions (ON/OFF and SLEEP buttons) and the second area to your own needs. To your own needs means that you can program buttons however you want. Because that was probably idea of buttons A and B.

The great design idea in the pilot is feedback after clicking each button. You will immediately see your action on remote control.
