-Although 2 bottom buttons might look strange as they're in the middle, but it is a better solution than
putting them in the corner due to the fits law (it is faster to catch those buttons from far corners). Furthermore,
we're putting a whole group of buttons in the left top corner. Regarding to Fitts Law, the width of at least
one button (top left corner) is always infinitive - we can put in this place the most frequalently clickable 
button. We've also decided to group all buttons in one panel instead of splitting them all over the screen,
because it's faster to switch between buttons in this case.

- Oliver's design is faster because buttons are sticked together in one group. The distance between
 all corner buttons is shorter. In Krishna`s approach the distance between buttons is bigger. That leads to
significantly longer selection time.
 

-The disadvantage of Oliver's design is that it's easier to missclick a button you want to choose, due to the 
lack of padding/margins between buttons. The solution for this problem is in Krishna's design. On his design 
the buttons are divided clearly, so you can distinguish buttons easily. Furthermore, in case of missing a button
it is very likely that you'll click a blank space (nothing happens). While in Oliver's tool palette missclick will
lead to running of undesirable program function. That's why every missclick influences overall selection time 
in a bad way.
